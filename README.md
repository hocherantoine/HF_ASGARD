# HF_ASGARD
Scripts corresponding to the review on histone fold proteins in Asgard archaea (To be published). 
All ASGARD genomes are available on NCBI, all eukaryotic proteomes from Eukprot.
The data corresponding to those scripts is available on Zenodo (Still private at the moment). 
Scrits are only provided to illustrate and provide details the analysis rather than being readily applicatble to any protein family as there is a non negligible degree of semi-automatic curation (e.g removing HF containing other PFAM domains but not excluding the PFAM domains which are similar to histones such as the NFY family..), if you feel like something is missing or requires more detail please do not hesitate to contact me if anything needs clarification.
